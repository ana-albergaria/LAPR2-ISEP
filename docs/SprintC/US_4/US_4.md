# US 04 - As a receptionist of the laboratory, I intend to register a test to be performed to a registered client.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a **receptionist** of the **laboratory**, I intend to register a **test** to be performed to a **registered client**.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*

**From the specifications document:**
 >"Typically, the client arrives at one of the clinical analysis laboratories with a lab order prescribed by
  a doctor. Once there, a receptionist asks the clientâ€™s citizen card number, the lab order (which
  contains the type of test and parameters to be measured), and registers in the application the test to
  be performed to that client"
>
 **From the client clarifications:**
 >Q1: When the receptionist chooses the test type, should the categories appear, and then when selecting the category, the receptionist can choose the parameters for the test? Or when the Receptionist chooses the test type, should appear all the parameters that it includes immediately?
 >
 >A1:Firstly, the receptionist should choose a test type. Then choose a category from a set of categories. Last, the receptionist should choose a parameter.
>
>Q1 Link [here](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8181).
>
>Q2: What are the attributes of a test and the acceptance criteria?
>
>A2: A test has the following attributes:
    Test code : Sequential number with 12 digits. The code is automatically generated.
    NHS code: 12 alphanumeric characters.
>
>Q2 Link [here](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8181).
>
>Q3:When the receptionist is registering a test for a client, the test can have more than one category and many parameters of the chosen categories or it only can have one category?
>
>A3: Each test can have more than one category.
>
>Q3 Link [here](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8522).
>
>Q4:On the project description we have multiple attributes of date and time ("date and time when the samples were collected", etc). Are these attributes filled by the author of the respective act or is it generated by the system when those acts are performed?
>
>A4: The system should automatically generate the date and time of the event (test registration, chemical analysis, diagnosis and validation).
>
>Q4 Link [here](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8442).


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1**: The receptionist must select the parameters to be analysed from all possible parameters in accordance with the test type.
* **AC2**: The test code must be sequential and have 12 digits.
* **AC3**: The NHS code must hold 12 alphanumeric digits.
* **AC4**: The test object must hold the date and time of test registration, chemical analysis, diagnosis and validation

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency with "US7 - To register a new employee" since the Receptionist must be registered in the system.
* There is a dependency with "US3 - To register a client" since the Client must be registered.
* There is a dependency with "US9 - To specify a new test type" since the test must be classfied in a test type.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

* Typed data:
    * NHS code
    * Client citizen card number
* Selected data:
    * Test type
    * Parameters

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

* Test
* TestType
* Parameter
* Client

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
* TestTypeStore
* ClientStore
* TestStore
* ParameterStore
* TestTypeDTO
* ParameterDTO
* TestTypeMapper
* ParameterMapper
* TestUI

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US4-SD](US4_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
###4.1 Test instances values:

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the TestType class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void createTestWithNullParameters(){
        app.domain.model.Test test = new app.domain.model.Test(null, null, null, null);
    }
	
**Test 2:** Check if it's not possible to create a Test with empty field for each attribute.
**For Example:**

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void createTestWithemptyNHScode(){
        Client client = new Client("1234567890123456", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345678901");
        app.domain.model.Test test = new app.domain.model.Test("", client, t1, parametersBlood);
    }

 
**Test 3:** Check if it is not possible to create a Test with each attribute's lenght not following the specified criteria.
> * **AC3**: The NHS code must hold 12 alphanumeric digits.

**For Example:**

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void createTestWithMore12CharsNHScode(){
        Client client = new Client("1234567890123456", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345678901");
        app.domain.model.Test test = new app.domain.model.Test("1234567890123", client, t1, parametersBlood);
    }

**Test 4** Check if it is not possible to create a Test with NHS code containing non alphanumeric characteres

**Test 5** Check if the auto generated code is sequencial and have 12 digits
**For Example:**

    @Test //this test checks if the generated number is 12 digits long
    public void ensureCodeis12digits(){
        Client client = new Client("1234567890123456", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345678601");
        app.domain.model.Test test = new app.domain.model.Test("123456789012", client, t1, parametersBlood);

        Assert.assertTrue(test.getCode().length() == 12);
    }
**Test 6** Check if samples cannot be added as null
**For Example:**

      @Test 
      public void ensureNotPossibleToAddNullSample() {
         TestStore testStore = new TestStore();
         Client client = new Client("1234567890123456", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345678601");
         app.domain.model.Test test = testStore.createTest("123456789012", client, t1, parametersBlood);
 
         Assert.assertFalse(test.addSample(null));
      }


###4.1 Test Store:

**Test 7** Check if it is not possible to add a test with being null

**Test 8** Check if it is not possible to add two identical tests to the test store

**Test 9** Check if tests with no samples are being found correctly
**For Example:**

     public void ensureTestsWithNoSamplesAreFound(){
        TestStore testStore = new TestStore();
        Client client = new Client("1234567890123456", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345678601");
        Client client2 = new Client("1234567890123458", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex1@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345675901");
        Client client3 = new Client("1234567890123457", "1234567890", d1, "Male", "1234567890", "alex3@gmail.com", "Alex", "12345688901");
        app.domain.model.Test test = testStore.createTest("123456789012", client, t1, parametersBlood);
        app.domain.model.Test test2 = testStore.createTest("123456789012", client2, t2, parametersCovid);
        app.domain.model.Test test3 = testStore.createTest("123456789012", client3, t1, parametersBlood);
        testStore.saveTest(test);
        testStore.saveTest(test2);
        testStore.saveTest(test3);


        Assert.assertEquals(testStore.getTestsWithNoSamples(), testStore.getTests());
    }
    
**Test 10** Check if tests are being found by barcode number
