# US 005 - Record the samples collected

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Medical Lab Technician, I want to record the samples collected in the scope of a
given test.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*  

**From the specifications document:**  

> All the tests (clinical blood tests and Covid-19 tests) performed by the network of laboratories are registered locally by the medical lab technicians who collect the samples.  
> 
> The samples are sent daily to the chemical laboratory where the chemical analysis are performed, and results obtained.  
> 
> When sampling (blood or swab) the medical lab technician records the samples in the system, associating the samples with the client/test, and identifying each sample with a barcode that is automatically generated using an external API. 

**From the client clarifications:**  

>**Q:** Our team, in order to implement the correct methods in our work, needs to know what's the data type that is returned by the External API Module that barcodes the sample.  
>**A:** The external API generates a Universal Product Code (UPC) code.  

You can read the whole discussion here.

> **Q:** What kind of attributes should a sample have?  
> **A:** Each sample is associated with a test. A sample has only one attribute, a barcode number (UPC) that is a sequential number and is automatically generated by the system. Each sample has a unique barcode number.  
> 
> **In US5, the medical lab technician checks the system and see all tests for which there are no samples collected. The medical lab technician selects a test and the system asks for the number of samples to collect.**  
> 
> **Q:** Can a test have more than one sample?  
> **A:** Yes.  
> 
> **Q:** We didn't fully understand what will the API do in this US, so here's out interpretation from the US, correct us if we're wrong please: The API will be generated randomly and the API is an attribute from the sample.  
> **A:** The API will be used to generate/print barcodes.

You can read the whole discussion [here](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244).  

> **Q:** After the barcodes are generated. The concept-reality link would be, for example to stick each barcode into each sample?  
> **A:** Yes. **Each generated barcode should be saved in a folder as a jpeg file.**  

You can read the whole discussion [here](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8437).  

> **Q:** It was answered in one of the previous questions that the sample only has one attribute, the barcode, however the description of the project also mentions a date of collection of the samples, is this date supposed to be an attribute of the test and not of the sample itself?  
> **A:** Yes. The system should record the date (DD/MM/YYYY) and time (HH:MM) when the sample is collect made. The date and time are automatically generated by the system when the barcode is issued.  
> 
> **Q:** If there were multiple samples for a single test, would there be only one collection date for all of them?  
> **A:** A: Only one collection date and time for a test.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The system should support several barcode APIs. The API to use is
defined by configuration.  
**AC2:** Each sample is associated with a test.  
**AC3:** Each generated barcode should be saved in a folder as a jpeg file.  

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency to:  

 * **"US007 Register a new Employee"** since at least a Medical Lab Technician must be registered as a user in the system.  
 * **"US004 Register a test to be performed to a registered client"** since at least a test must be registered in the system in order to associate the samples to the test.  

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

*Identity here the data to be inputted by the system actor as well as the output data that the system have/needs to present in order to properly support the actor actions. Regarding the inputted data, it is suggested to distinguish between typed data and selected data (e.g. from a list)*  

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * number of samples to collect

* Selected data:
    * selecting a test for which samples need to be collected

**Output Data:**

* List of existing tests for which there are no samples collected
* (In)Success of the operation


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.* 


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.* 

![USXX-MD](USXX-MD.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Sample
 * Company
 * Test **APAGAR?**

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:  

 * RecordSamplesUI  
 * RecordSamplesController  
 * TestStore  
 * TestMapper  
 * ExternalAPI  
 * ExternalAPIAdapterX

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXX-SD](USXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXX-CD](USXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
